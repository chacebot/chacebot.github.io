title: Moving Across America During Corona Virus Pandemic
---


My first non technical post here. It is a brief one. 

After living in Northern California for three years, the corona virus pandemic pushed our over priced confined space living tolerance over the edge and we decided to move back to the more afforable and less hazardous east coast US for a better quality of life.

I landed a new job at a great UK based consultancy company and am excited to start contributing there. Very gratefull for them.

My wife Lily and I are about to begin a 3500 mile journey across the US via our 2016 Acura RDX. Wish us luck. 



(Addendum from 07-07-2020) Here is a picture of Utah grabbed during the second day of our journey:
