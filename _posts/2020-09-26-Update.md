title: Update for Future Posts
---


Short post here because I am busy learning. Currently on a parrallel path of HTML + CSS (to make this blog easier to look at) in addition to working on a tutorial for Webots - a robotics physics engine with an integrated control code  development enviroment. My goal with Webots is to use it to learn inverse kinematics and apply that to the motion of a robotic arm assembly using the Robotics Library.

Anyways, here is a short list of topics I plan on discussing in the future when I have time to write about them:

- Motion Allocator on chacebot
- Cpp Testing
- Using vim
- Using sockets to communicate between python and cpp
- Launching programs on boot with raspberry pi
- Shell scripts
- Custom HTML + CSS
- Javascript
- Python backend with Apache server on google cloud
- Robotics motion control with Inverse Kinematics
