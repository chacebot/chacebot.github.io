# A glimpse into my work.

I am a seasoned professional with a passion for robotics and
software development, specializing in Perception, Motion
Control, and Manipulation.

My expertise encompasses a wide range of technologies and tools,
including ROS (Robot Operating System), C++, Python, OpenCV, and
PyTorch, which I leverage to design and implement innovative
robotics solutions. With a deep understanding of kinematics, PID
control, and stereo cameras, I excel in creating robust systems
that push the boundaries of what's possible in the field of
robotics.

In addition to my proficiency in robotics, I have a strong
background in web app development, where I utilize technologies
such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and SQL to build intuitive and
efficient web applications. My skills extend to backend
development using Python, REST API design, and database
management, enabling me to create seamless user experiences
across a variety of platforms.
