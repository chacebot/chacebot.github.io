        <h2><a href="/2020/06/21/Firmware.html">21 Jun 2020: Code Walkthrough, FreeRTOS and libopencm3 on the Chacebot Microcontroller</a></h2>
        <p><p>Chacebot uses an STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller to intrepret PWM signals from a three channel RC reciever and streams the values over the serial port to control the drivetrain of the robot. This post contains an overview of the hardware setup and explains the firmware I implemented to make this embedded system work efficently. The code I developed in this project is an extension from a chapter in Warren Gay’s book : <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-STM32-Developing-FreeRTOS-libopencm3/dp/1484236238">Beginning STM32: Developing with FreeRTOS, libopencm3 and GCC</a>, specifically Chapter 17 titled “PWM Input with Timer 4”.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/05/11/Chacebot.html">11 May 2020: My RC Controlled Robot - Chacebot. Powered by ROS, C++, and Raspberry PI</a></h2>
        <p><p>Chacebot has been my side project over the past month and it has been a very fun platform for me to demonstrate my C++ skills and get more hands on experience with the Robotic Operating System (ROS).</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/04/01/Udacity.html">01 Apr 2020: First Post! Udacity C++ Nanodegree</a></h2>
        <p><p>I graduated from the Udacity C++ Nanodegree program this week and I feel very good about what I accomplished over the past four months. Prior to this class my programming experience was mainly python and at the intermediate level. I had a firm grasp on computer science fundamentals and understood the main principles behind object oriented programming. However I still did not know much about the difference between dynamically scripted languages such as python and compiled languages like C++. I also did not know much about algorithms and how they are structured to produce useful output stemming from basic data input.</p>
