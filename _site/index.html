        <p><p>I graduated from the Udacity C++ Nanodegree program this week and I feel very good about what I accomplished over the past four months. Prior to this class my programming experience was mainly python and at the intermediate level. I had a firm grasp on computer science fundamentals and understood the main principles behind object oriented programming. However I still did not know much about the difference between dynamically scripted languages such as python and compiled languages like C++. I also did not know much about algorithms and how they are structured to produce useful output stemming from basic data input.</p>
